TITLE: Hytale Model Maker (HMM) & Visual Style
SOURCE: Hytale Model Maker Trailer
TYPE: Art Asset Guide

1. Cuboids and Planes
- Hytale models are made of "Cuboids" (Boxes) and "Planes" (2D flat surfaces).
- Complex meshes (like spheres or high-poly curves) are NOT supported. Everything must be blocky to fit the aesthetic.
- Standard texture resolution is 32x or 64x grids per block face.

2. The Hierarchy (Parent-Child)
- Models rely on a strict hierarchy (Bone structure).
- Example for a Human:
  - Body (Root)
    - Head (Child of Body)
    - Arm_Left (Child of Body)
      - Hand_Left (Child of Arm)
        - ITEM_HOLDER (Attachment Point)

3. Attachments & Points
- To allow a character to hold a weapon, the model needs a defined "Attachment Point" (usually named 'main_hand' or similar).
- Particles (like fire on a sword) also spawn from these specific coordinates defined in the model.

4. Animation Style
- Animations are keyframe-based interpolation.
- Do not use "motion capture" style fluidity; keep animations snappy and expressive (RPG style).
