TITLE: Scripting Syntax & JSON Schemas
SOURCE: Deduced from Hytale Blog Screenshots
TYPE: Coding Standards

1. Naming Conventions
- IDs: Must be snake_case and namespaced. (e.g., "gaia_mods:obsidian_sword")
- Files: Should match the ID (e.g., "obsidian_sword.json")

2. JSON Structure for Items (Blueprint)
Items are typically defined with these fields:
- "id": The unique identifier.
- "model": Path to the .hym (Hytale Model) file.
- "name": Display name.
- "behavior": Links to script files.

Example Structure (Mockup):
{
  "id": "my_mod:fire_blade",
  "name": "Blade of Embers",
  "tier": "legendary",
  "model": "models/weapons/fire_blade.hym",
  "components": {
    "damage": 50,
    "damage_type": "fire",
    "durability": 1200
  }
}

3. Scripting Logic (AI Behaviors)
Mobs use "Behavior Trees" or "State Machines".
- Idle State: Look around, walk randomly.
- Aggro State: Detect player within radius X, switch to Chase.
- Attack State: When range < 2, play animation "slash".
