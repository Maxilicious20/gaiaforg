1. Client-Server Architecture
Hytale uses a strict Client-Server model.
- The Server is authoritative (it decides what happens).
- The Client is for prediction and rendering.
- When creating mods, logic usually resides on the server to prevent cheating, while visuals (models, particles) are handled by the client.

2. Entity Component System (ECS)
Hytale does NOT use standard OOP inheritance (like "Dog extends Animal").
It uses an Entity Component System (ECS).
- Entities are just empty containers (IDs).
- You add "Components" to them to give them traits.
- Example: To make a rock move, you don't make a "MovingRock" class; you add a "PhysicsComponent" and a "VelocityComponent" to a rock entity.

3. Content Loading & Hot Reloading
- Hytale supports "Hot Reloading". Modders can change a texture or a JSON file, and it updates in-game immediately without restarting.
- Assets are defined in JSON, behavior is defined in scripts.
